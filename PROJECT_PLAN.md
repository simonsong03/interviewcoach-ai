## Project Name
InterviewCoach AI

## Problem
People struggle to practice interview answers and receive clear, objective feedback on how they sound.

## Core Flow
Upload audio → transcribe → analyze → structured feedback.

## Non-Goals
- No real-time audio recording
- No authentication or user accounts
- No mobile app
- No live interviews

## Tech Stack
Frontend: React / Next.js  
Backend: FastAPI (Python)  
AI: Whisper (speech-to-text) + LLM (analysis)

## MVP Definition
A user inputs an interview questions then uploads a short audio response (30–90 seconds) and receives structured feedback on clarity, confidence, filler words, and an improved example response.
